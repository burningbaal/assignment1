I like to spend my time remodelling my house with my wife and brewing beer.  
I will be welcoming my first child into the world this August, which should be quite the adventure.
I have a greyhound who's scared of hardwood floors, but not of stone or vinyl floors.
I moved to the Seattle area from Oregon in August 2012 after spending most of my life in Corvallis.
