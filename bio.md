I like to spend my time remodelling my house with my wife and brewing beer.  
I will be welcoming my first child into the world this August, which should be quite the adventure.
I have a greyhound named Hank who is scared to walk on hardwood floors but loves to run in the backyard, sometimes through blackberries.
